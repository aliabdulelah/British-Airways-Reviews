<br>

7. Are the rating scores depicting an upward or downward over time?
From March 2016 to October 2023, there's a noticeable downward trend in the rating scores. This decline seems to stem from various factors. Initially, there was a significant dip in reviews during 2020, likely due to widespread flight cancellations amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, BA's decision to reduce flights again in early 2022, prompted by the emergence of the Omicron variant, contributed to the negative slope. Additionally, the existence of a class action lawsuit against BA for its handling of refunds related to COVID-19 cancellations further impacts customer sentiment. While speculative, it's plausible that these events and BA's treatment of customers during and after the pandemic have contributed to the declining trend in review scores since 2022.
